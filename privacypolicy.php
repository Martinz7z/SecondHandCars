At SecondHandCars, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not 
differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable 
individual or that is linked or linkable to them by SecondHandCars as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.
 This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not 
 directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — 
 is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers how SecondHandCars or an SecondHandCars-affiliated company (collectively, SecondHandCars) 
handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet),
 or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services
  or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. SecondHandCars's Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties
   define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights
    before interacting with them.
